Mostly adequate guide to FP (in Swift)

Whatever are we doing here?  Well we are attempting to reason about the [Mostly Adequate Guide](https://github.com/MostlyAdequate/mostly-adequate-guide) but through the lense of Swift!

Goals
- Work through exercises using Swift
- Translate portions of the text to use `Swift`

I'm working through the book now with a book club so the first goal is reasonable.  a fully remixed "Swift" version is ambitious but not out of the question.
